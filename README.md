# Smart Home Automation System using IoT - README

Welcome to the Smart Home Automation System using IoT repository!

This repository contains the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document for a Smart Home Automation System using IoT. Below is an overview of the contents and how to navigate through them:

1. **SRS Document**: The SRS document outlines the software requirements and specifications for the Smart Home Automation System. It includes detailed sections such as introduction, revision history, overall description, specific requirements, external interface requirements, nonfunctional requirements, design, testing, and more.

2. **Diagrams**:
   - Data Flow Diagrams (DFD): DFDs illustrate the flow of data within the system, depicting the processes, data stores, and data flows involved.
   - UML Diagrams: Various UML diagrams, including use-case diagrams, class diagrams, activity diagrams, and sequence diagrams, provide a visual representation of the system's structure and behavior.

3. **Testing**: Test cases are provided to ensure the functionality and reliability of the Smart Home Automation System. These test cases cover general, transaction-related, and authorization-related scenarios to validate the system's behavior under different conditions.

Feel free to explore the documents and diagrams to gain a comprehensive understanding of the Smart Home Automation System. If you have any questions or need further clarification on any aspect of the project, don't hesitate to reach out.
